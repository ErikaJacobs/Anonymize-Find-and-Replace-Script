# Anonymize Data in Multiple Files With a Click
This repository contains a simple script that finds and replaces text in multiple text-based files without having to physically open them. This script was developed as part of the [Excel Python SQL Migration](https://github.com/ErikaJacobs/Excel-Python-SQL-Migration) project, based on a need for anonymizing private data prior to sharing work on GitHub. While this script is not a large scale project, it is VERY powerful and useful if you find yourself needing to anonymize shared scripts.
